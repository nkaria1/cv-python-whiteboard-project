# cv-python-whiteboard-project
In this project i am going to use python's open-cv library to read a video stream and detect a specific color(red/blue/orange) and use this color to be used as a marker tip. Then as the object of the chosen color moves in the visible area, i will trace the pixels to create the effect of a virtual white board.
